**🐢 Bid Racing Game (Python)**
===
An interactive Python Turtle graphics racing game where players place a bet on which turtle will win the race. Each turtle moves randomly, making every race exciting and unpredictable.

---
**📌 Project Description**

The Bid Racing Game allows users to bet on a turtle by choosing a color before the race starts.
Multiple turtles race across the screen, and the winner is determined by random movement speed.

This project demonstrates GUI-based interaction, basic animation, and game logic using Python’s Turtle and Tkinter modules.

**🛠️ Technologies Used**

* Python 3
* Turtle Graphics
* Tkinter (for user input dialog)
* Random module

---
**▶️ How It Works**

1. The screen opens with a race track
2. The user is prompted to place a bet by entering a turtle color
3. Six turtles are created, each with a unique color and position
4. The race begins once a bet is placed
4. Turtles move forward randomly in small steps
5. The first turtle to cross the finish line wins
6. The result is displayed in the console

**🎮 Example Gameplay 1**

    Which turtle will win the race? Enter a color: red
    You've won! red turtle is the winner!

**🎮 Example Gameplay 2**

    Which turtle will win the race? Enter a color: blue
    You've lost! green turtle is the winner!

**🎯 What I Learned**

* Using Turtle graphics for animations
* Handling user input with Tkinter dialogs
* Creating multiple objects dynamically
* Implementing random movement
* Managing game state and win conditions

---
**🚀 Future Improvements**

* Display winner message on screen instead of console
* Add restart/play-again option
* Show betting odds
* Add finish line graphics
* Increase number of racers
